	<h1>Welcome to appserver.io</h1>

	<p>appserver.io is a next generation PHP infrastructure. It is not
		a webserver like Apache or nginx, nor a Timer-Service or
		Message-Queue. It is all of them and much more in one extremely
		powerful bundle. And it is completely written in PHP enabling PHP
		developers to adapt appserver.io to their specific needs with no
		additional coding language - just PHP!</p>

	<h1>Basic Usage</h1>

	<p>The appserver will automatically start after your installation
		wizard (or package manager) finishes the setup. You can use it without
		limitations from now on.</p>

	<p>Below you can find basic instructions on how to make use of the
		appserver. After the installation you might want to have a look and
		the bundled example application. The example application shows basic
		usage of services. Use your favorite browser and open the URL
	<pre>http://127.0.0.1:9080/example</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
		You will see that we provide basic frontend implementations of
		services the appserver runtime provides. If you want to use these
		services yourself you should have a look into the sourcecode and read
		our tutorial about starting your own <a target="_blank"
			href="http://appserver.io/get-started/tutorials/my-first-webapp.html">webapp</a>.
	</p>

	<p>You might be curious about the different port we use. Per
		default the appserver will open several ports at which it's services
		are available. As we do not want to block (or be blocked by) other
		services we use ports of a higher range.</p>

	<p>As a default we use the following ports for the Web-Container:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>HTTP-Server: 9080</li>
		<li>HTTPS-Server: 9443</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For the Persistence-Container we use:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Persistence-Container: 8585</li>
		<li>Message-Queue: 8587</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You can change this default port mapping by using the configuration
		file. If you are interested in our naming, you can see our
		Container-Server Pattern, you might want to have a deeper look into
		our <a target="_blank"
			href="http://appserver.io/get-started/documentation/configuration.html">architecture.</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Services</h2>

	<p>Since appserver.io version 1.0.2 we provide and also install
		services during the installation process. This means, that you don't
		have to start or restart appserver.io after installation.</p>

	<p>If you need to stop/start/restart the appserver.io, this can be
		done with the Windows Services which are available under Control Panel
		> System and Security > Administrative Tools > Services or the command
		line. When using Windows Services, simply select the service to be
		restarted, open the context menue and click on the restart entry.</p>

	<p>Another option to start/stop a service is the commandline.
		Therefore open a commandline as Administrator and type
	<pre>net stop appserver
       </pre>
	to stop the appserver service and
	<pre>net start appserver</pre>
	to start it again. A more detailed documentation can be found in the
	Microsoft
	<a target="_blank"
		href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736564%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">TechNet</a>.
	</p>

	<p>On a Windows system only the appserver and the
		appserver-php5-fpm services are functional actually. To ultimately run
		the appserver only the appserver process is needed but you will miss
		simple on-the-fly deployment (appserver-watcher) and might have
		problems with legacy applications. Depending on the FastCGI backend
		you want to use you might ditch appserver-php5-fpm for other processes
		e. g. supplying you with a HHVM backend.</p>

	<h2>Start and Stop Scripts</h2>

	<p>The second option, which is not the recommended one, to
		start/stop/restart services is to use the batch files, delivered with
		appserver.io.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>appserver.bat: The main process which will start the
			appserver itself</li>

		<li>appserver-php5-fpm.bat: PHP-FPM + appserver configuration.
			Our default FastCGI backend. Others might be added the same way</li>

		<li>appserver-watcher.bat: A watchdog which monitors filesystem
			changes and manages appserver restarts</li>
	</ul>
